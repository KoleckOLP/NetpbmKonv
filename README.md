# NetpbmKonv
A simple Netpbm converter (only supporting ASCII for now)

My friend who went to Uni (unlike me) got a homework to write a coverter for the Newpbm picture formats.<br>
I really liked how the ASCII version looks and begin to study it.<br>
His task was to write a converter between all of the formats(ASCII and RAW) in C.<br>
But I don't really like C, and my plan is just to get the ASCII conversions.<br>

I may add the RAW(binary) support too. If I'm bored or willing to learn it.<br>
I have chosen to write this as a code practise, something like AdventOfCode.<br>

### !!! I don't think you want to use this because there is like billion better ones. (for example gimp) !!!
but if you do, current version has no requirements apart from:<br>
python 3<br>

how to use:
> python main.py inputfile outputfile

for example:

> python main.py testing\lol.pbm testing\test_pbm.pgm
